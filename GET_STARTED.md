## **ðŸ”¹ Usage**
Jhol works like `npm` and `yarn`, but is optimized for better caching and offline support.

### **Installing a Package**
To install a package, use:
```sh
jhol install <package-name>
```
Example:
```sh
jhol install axios
```
This will:
- Check if the package is cached.
- If cached, install it **without downloading**.
- If not, fetch it from **NPM** and cache it for future offline use.

#### **Installing Specific Versions**
You can install specific versions like this:
```sh
jhol install react@17.0.0 react@18.0.0
```
Jhol will fetch and cache both versions.

---
### **Checking and Fixing Dependencies**
Jhol comes with an **intelligent dependency checker**.

#### **Check for Issues**
```sh
jhol doctor
```
This scans your project for missing or outdated dependencies.

#### **Automatically Fix Issues**
```sh
jhol doctor --fix
```
This updates outdated packages and installs missing ones.

---
## **ðŸ”¹ How Does Jhol Work?**
1. **Cache First** â€“ If a package exists in Jholâ€™s cache, it installs instantly.
2. **Fallback to NPM** â€“ If not found, Jhol fetches the package from **NPM**.
3. **Offline Mode** â€“ If the network is offline, Jhol still installs from cache.
4. **Dependency Fixing** â€“ Detects outdated or broken dependencies and fixes them.

---
## **ðŸ”¹ Advanced Features**
### **Clearing the Cache**
```sh
rm -rf ~/.jhol-cache
```
On Windows:
```powershell
rd /s /q %USERPROFILE%\.jhol-cache
```
This forces Jhol to fetch fresh packages.

### **Logging**
Jhol maintains logs of package installations in:
```
~/.jhol-cache/logs.txt
```
You can check past installations and errors here.
